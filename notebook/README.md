This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs data analysis on suicide rates. The notebook includes the following sections:

1. Data Loading: Imports the necessary libraries and loads the dataset.
2. Data Cleaning: Processes the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and renaming columns.
3. Data Transformation: Maps countries to continents, adjusts categorical columns, and orders them accordingly.
4. Data Analysis: Conducts statistical analysis, such as calculating the total suicide counts across various demographics.
5. Data Visualization: Creates visualizations like bar plots and pie charts to represent the data insights.
6. Processed Data: The cleaned and transformed data is saved into a CSV file, which can be used for further analysis or model building.
